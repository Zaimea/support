# Zaimea Support

Centralized support repository for all Zaimea packages and projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as the single, centralized place for **support questions**, **issue triage**, and **general assistance** across all Zaimea-owned packages and applications.

Use this repository **only for support-related inquiries**. Feature requests and bug reports must remain in their corresponding package repositories.

## ✅ What You Can Ask Here

* Questions about how to use any Zaimea package
* Questions about installation, configuration, or integration
* Requests for clarification on documentation
* Help diagnosing errors or unexpected behavior
* Discussions about general workflows involving multiple Zaimea packages

## ❌ What Does *Not* Belong Here

* Bug reports → please open them in the dedicated package repository
* Feature ideas → open an issue in the correct package repo
* Security issues → email [security@zaimea.com](mailto:security@zaimea.com)

## 📝 How to Ask for Support

Please include:

1. A clear title describing the problem
2. The package name and version you are using
3. Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
4. Expected vs. actual behavior
5. Code samples, stack traces, or screenshots when helpful

Example:

```
[Package] zaimea/charts v1.4.2
[Question] How do I customize the default color palette?
```

## 🤝 Community Guidelines

* Be respectful and concise
* Use issue templates when provided
* Avoid duplicate questions (search first!)

## 🛠 Maintainers Workflow

When issues appear here, maintainers will:

1. Answer general support questions directly
2. Redirect the user to the correct repository if necessary
3. Convert misplaced bug reports into issues in the proper package repo (linking back)
